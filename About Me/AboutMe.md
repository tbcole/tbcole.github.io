# About Me

I am located in Delft, Netherlands pursuing a Master's degree in quantum computing and quantum devices at the Delft University of Technology. 
Prior to this, I graduated from West Virginia University in the USA with a B.S. in Physics. My research interests are generally in the theoretical study
of quantum transport properties in mesoscopic systems and topologically non-trivial properties of materials. I have published work on topological 
superconductivity in planar Josephson junctions in 2021 and am currently working on constructing a theory of position dependent perturbations acting on 
band-insulators. I plan to pursue a Ph.D. after completing my Master's degree.
